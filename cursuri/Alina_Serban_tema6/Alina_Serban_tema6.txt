calculates the average movie budget per genre using pandas, and visualizes the result in a bar chart using seaborn and matplotlib.

1. Connects to MySQL using mysql.connector
2. Executes a SQL query joining movie, movie_genre, and genre tables
3. Loads the data into a pandas DataFrame
4. Calculates average budgets grouped by genre
5. Visualizes the average budgets as a bar chart

The result is shown in a plot titled 'Bugetul Mediu al Filmelor pe Gen'.
